// Explain the difference btw frontend and backend development ?
// FrontEnd
// 1=> FrontEnd Refers to the client-side of an application 
// 2=> It is the part of a web application that users can see and interact with 
// 3=> HTML,CSS,JS,AngularJS and ReactJs are some of the essentials of Frontend Developemnt

// BacKend 
// 1=> Backend refers to the server-side of an application 
// 2=> It constitutes everything that happens behind the scene 
// 3=>  Java,PHP,Python and Nodejs are some of the backend development technologies

// what is NPM  ?
//Ans: Npm Stand for Nodejs Package Manager, Responsible for managing all the packages and modules for nodejs.
// Node Package Manager provides two main functionalities:
// Provides online repositories for node.js packages/modules, which are searchable on search.nodejs.org
// Provides command-line utility to install Node.js packages and also manages Node.js versions and dependencies  

// Which database is more popularly used with Node.js?
// MongoDB is the most common database used with Node.js. It is a NoSQL, cross-platform, document-oriented database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.

// What are some of the most commonly used libraries in Node.js?
// There are two commonly used libraries in Node.js:
// ExpressJS - Express is a flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a wide set of features to develop web and mobile applications.
// Mongoose - Mongoose is also a Node.js web application framework that makes it easy to connect an application to a database.

// What is an Event Loop in Node.js?
// Event loops handle asynchronous callbacks in Node.js. It is the foundation of the non-blocking input/output in Node.js, making it one of the most important environmental features.

// What is an EventEmitter in Node.js?
// EventEmitter is a class that holds all the objects that can emit events
// Whenever an object from the EventEmitter class throws an event, all attached functions are called upon synchronously

// What is the package.json file?
// The package.json file is the heart of a Node.js system. This file holds the metadata for a particular project. The package.json file is found in the root directory of any Node application or module

// This is what a package.json file looks like immediately after creating a Node.js project using the command: npm init
// You can edit the parameters when you create a Node.js project.

// What is the Express.js package?
// Express is a flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a wide set of features to develop both web and mobile applications

// What is the control flow function?
// The control flow function is a piece of code that runs in between several asynchronous function calls.

// What is middleware?
// Middleware comes in between your request and business logic. It is mainly used to capture logs and enable rate limit, routing, authentication, basically whatever that is not a part of business logic. There are third-party middleware also such as body-parser and you can write your own middleware for a specific use case

// In Nodejs ,"model" usually refer to the component of Model-View-Controller(MVC) architecture.
// The model represent the data and the business logic of an application .
// Mongoose: A MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.

// Sequelize: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for Node.js that supports several SQL databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

// Waterline: An ORM for Node.js that provides a common interface for working with various databases, including MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

// Bookshelf: An ORM for Node.js that is built on top of Knex.js and supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.

// These modules provide convenient ways to define, manipulate, and query data within an application, making it easier to work with databases and data models in Node.js.

// In Node.js, "/:_id" is a route parameter that is used to define a dynamic route for a URL. The colon (:) preceding "_id" indicates that it is a parameter, and the value of this parameter can be anything that matches the route pattern.

// In Node.js, routes are used to define how the application responds to client requests for specific URLs (or URI paths). A route is typically made up of an HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and a URL pattern that defines the endpoint that the client is trying to access.

// In Node.js, a schema is a way of defining the structure of a data model for a database, typically using a schema definition language or an object modeling tool. A schema defines the properties of a model and their types, and can also specify relationships between models and any validation rules that should be enforced.

// Schemas are commonly used in Node.js applications that interact with databases, such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL, as they provide a consistent way of defining data models and ensuring that the data is consistent and well-structured.

// For example, using the Mongoose schema definition tool in Node.js, you can define a schema for a User model as follows:

// In Node.js, the require() function is used to load modules or packages into your application. When you use require(), Node.js searches for the specified module or package and loads it into memory so that you can use its functionality in your application.

// Building an e-commerce API in Node.js involves several steps:

// Design the API: Determine what endpoints you need to create for your e-commerce API, and what data you need to send and receive. Consider the security of your API, and how you will handle authentication and authorization.

// Choose a database: Decide on a database to store your e-commerce data. Some popular choices include MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. You will need to create a database schema that matches the data you will store.

// Choose a framework: Choose a Node.js framework that supports building RESTful APIs. Some popular choices include Express.js, Koa.js, and Nest.js.

// Set up the project: Create a new Node.js project using npm, and install the necessary dependencies. You will need to install your chosen framework, as well as any libraries you need for authentication, validation, and database access.

// Define routes: Define the routes for your API, including the HTTP method, the URL endpoint, and the function that will handle the request. You can use middleware to handle authentication and validation.

// Connect to the database: Connect your API to your chosen database. You can use a database ORM (such as Sequelize or Mongoose) to simplify database access.

// Implement CRUD operations: Implement the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each endpoint. You will need to use the database ORM to access and modify the data in the database.

// Test the API: Test your API using a tool like Postman to make requests and verify that the responses are correct.

// Deploy the API: Deploy your API to a hosting service like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean. You will need to configure your environment variables and ensure that your database is also deployed and accessible.

// Building an e-commerce API in Node.js can be complex, but it allows you to create a flexible and scalable platform for your e-commerce business. With careful planning and attention to security, you can build an API that provides a seamless experience for your customers and supports your business needs.
